 # Explaination 
  Using OpenCV python library and haarcscade xml files detect the face and create a bounding box around the face.
  Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. 
  1. Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify.
  2. Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.
